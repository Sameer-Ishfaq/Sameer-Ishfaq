- 👋 Hi, I’m @Sameer-Ishfaq
- 👀 I’m interested in a lot of things inside my qualification and outside. I like reading,learning how to better myself,exercising and exploring new areas. In my course im very excited to learn how to write the different types of code and what they are used for.
- 🌱 I’m currently studying a L5 (HND) qualification in computing and IT after having come from engineering.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate with fellow beginners and experts so that i can learn from them. Everyone is different and we may be able to share different perspectives that we may have never thought of.
- 📫 You can reach me by my email, sameerishfaq0@gmail.com
